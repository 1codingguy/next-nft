## Main takeaway:
1. To put previously learnt Solidity knowledge into practice
2. Learnt writing test with Hardhat, which is similar to Truffle.
3. Deploying and testing contracts on local chain seems easier with Hardhat compared to Truffle.


Discontinue this code along learning. Because I am not yet familiar with stuff like connecting the frontend to wallet, interacting with contract deployed on chain. Also changes from Infura (Polygon needs a billable account, changes in IPFS API) makes it hard to follow along. I think it's possible to subsitute these with Moralis or some other node providers but not sure.

### Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
